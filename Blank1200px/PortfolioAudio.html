		<p class="vertical">"Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start thinking about them<br> as triggers for experiences... That solves a lot of problems ... Art is <br>something that happens, a process, not a quality, and all sorts of <br>things can make it happen ... What makes a work of art 'good' <br>for you is not something that is already 'inside' it, but<br> something that happens inside you." ~ Brian Eno</p>

I challenged myself to work outside of my confort zone and create an ambient track with a number of other creative restrictions.  This song was inspired by the works of Akira Yamoaka, specifically those he created for the "Silent Hill" video game series.</p>
